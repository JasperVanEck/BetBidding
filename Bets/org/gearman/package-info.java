/**
 * The java-gearman-service is an implementation of the Gearman framework,
 * used to farm out work to other machines or processes that are better suited
 * to do the work. It allows you to do work in parallel, to load balance
 * processing, and to call functions between languages. It can be used in a
 * variety of applications, from high-availability web sites to the transport
 * of database replication events. In other words, it is the nervous system
 * for how distributed processing communicates.
